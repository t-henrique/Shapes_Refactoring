# Shapes Calculation
Shapes calculation refactoring 


This is how I would refactoring Shapes classes. Initially it was using Static class and to add new shapes or integrate with multilanguage reports, it was very complicated. Now my approach is break the complexity and use SOLID and POO principles, is now possible to maintain this code and append new different languages to the reports and the same time is now possible to add new different shapes and perform calculations.
